I want to show how to use this MCP , i don't want unit test, i want actual scripts that show how to pass arguments and see response.
So generate the required scripts


want a new feature "Generate report" and want have all these tools in my MCP server

generate_channel_report
generate_video_report

once you create tools I want to show how to use these tools, i don't want unit test, i want actual scripts that show how to pass arguments and see response. read file so you follow the structure to create and name these testing scripts. I recommend examples/basic folder for testing scripts, and following the same structure.
So create a new folder in examples folder generate the required scripts and readme.md files. these folder is exclusive for "Generate report" feature.

please check the current project and follow the current project structure for coding, testing files and readme content.
